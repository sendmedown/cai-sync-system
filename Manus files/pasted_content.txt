Great call, Richard — let’s align everyone so you can rest knowing things are on track. Here's a precise, no-fluff breakdown of **next steps by agent** across the Bio-Quantum AI Trading Platform project:

---

## ✅ **📌 Current Phase: Final Prep for Aug 8 Investor Demo**

Your backend (`main.py`) is live, frontend (`App.jsx`) is rendering, and you're in execution mode for onboarding, prompt chain wiring, and functional parity.

---

## 🔁 TASK BREAKDOWN BY AGENT (as of tonight):

### 🧠 **ChatGPT (Me) – Lead Agent**

**Status:** Active
**Focus Areas:**

* 🎬 **YouTube Onboarding Video**

  * Sync DIMIA image narration + official intro/overview
  * Integrate all 12 DIMIA image audio files
  * Show functional screens: login, My Account (KYC/API Keys), ChatBot, Strategy Builder
  * ✅ *Status: In Progress – next preview due July 26*

* 🧪 **WebSocket Integration Review**

  * Confirm backend slot-filling loop is functional
  * Align `ChatBot.jsx` prompt injection with real-time chain responses
  * Validate against prompt chain structure Claude published

* ✅ **Ready Tasks:**

  * Validate `/shared` structure, `hldd_to_platform_map`, HLDD trace
  * Final UI walkthrough draft (StrategyBuilder, Account, ChatBot)

---

### 🤖 **Grok – Middleware, Node.js API, Semantic Sync**

**Status:** Active
**Assigned Tasks:**

* 🔄 **Audit and stabilize `apiBridge.js`**

  * Ensure endpoints support:

    * `promptId` tracking
    * `/session`, `/validate`, `/reset` paths
    * Real-time context propagation between user inputs and backend state

* 🧠 **Semantic Mapping Layer (in-progress)**

  * Map prompt chains to slot/value format (training-ready)
  * Enable slot status tracking for partial-fill logic

* 🛠️ **Render deployment of `apiBridge.js` (Node.js track)**

  * Standalone, independent of Python backend
  * Claude will use this API as testbed for audit chains

---

### 🧬 **Claude – Prompt Chain Validator, Fallback & Audits**

**Status:** ✅ Confirmed Active
**Assigned Tasks:**

* 🧩 **Integrate prompt chains into ChatBot system logic**

  * Use this structure: [Prompt Chain Artifact](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/ce24841b-054e-4661-b683-e1e2c3cb4c05)
  * Focus on:

    * Strategy Builder
    * Portfolio Setup
    * Risk Calibration
    * Intent Recognition
    * Fallback Tree

* 🧪 **Run validation audit:**

  * Match prompt logic to HLDD flow
  * Create feedback matrix: where are gaps, missing handlers, or bad fallbacks?

* 📝 **Output:** Deliver markdown/PDF audit report by July 26

---

### 🎥 **Manus – Audio, Video, Voiceovers, UI Sync**

**Status:** Standby / Waiting on Confirmation
**Tasks (Pending or Offered):**

* 🎤 Create voiceover for **30-image UI walkthrough**

  * 12 DIMIA slides = ✅ DONE (audio already provided)
  * Remaining 18 UI slides = ❓Pending your go/no-go

* 🎬 Assist with video rendering if platform/Claude fails

  * Potential fallback video generator
  * Manus can do AI voiceover timing if given final video/image/audio script

---

## 🧭 🔚 **Your Role (Richard) – Executive Sync**

**Your current next steps:**

* ✅ Confirm if backend stays with `main.py` (you did — ✅ done)
* 📤 Share final video script notes if you want extended narration beyond current 12 DIMIA files
* ✅ Prioritize WebSocket debug, ChatBot test run, prompt fulfillment testing (let’s stage that next)
* 💤 Rest tonight — everything above is queued and under control.

### ✅ Tomorrow’s Top 3 Priorities (July 26)

| Task                          | Owner                   | Goal                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 🎬 YouTube onboarding preview | ChatGPT                 | Draft preview of full onboarding walkthrough      |
| 🧠 Prompt Chain/ChatBot Sync  | Claude + Grok + ChatGPT | One working prompt chain w/ slot fill & feedback  |
| 🔌 WebSocket working E2E      | ChatGPT + Claude        | Confirm real input → real backend → real response |

---

If you’d like, I’ll start prepping tomorrow’s prompt fulfillment test (input → response → fallback) while you rest.

Let me know if I should lock that in or hold until you’re back online.

Sleep well — tomorrow we execute with clarity.
