## File Naming Conventions

### Documents
- Use descriptive names with underscores: `HLDD_Security_Framework.md`
- Include version numbers for major revisions: `API_Spec_v2.1.md`
- Use date prefixes for time-sensitive content: `2025-07-07_Progress_Report.md`

### Tasks
- Format: `TASK_[Priority]_[Category]_[Description].md`
- Example: `TASK_HIGH_Security_Implement_Quantum_Encryption.md`

### Assets
- Use semantic names: `Bio_Quantum_Architecture_Diagram.png`
- Include dimensions for images: `Dashboard_Screenshot_1920x1080.png`
- Version control for iterative assets: `Logo_v3_Final.svg`

## Synchronization Behavior

### Automatic Sync
- **Real-time monitoring:** Changes are detected and synced within 30 seconds
- **Bidirectional sync:** Changes in Notion are reflected locally
- **Conflict resolution:** Automatic merging with manual override options

### Content Processing
- **Markdown files:** Converted to Notion pages with preserved formatting
- **CSV files:** Imported as Notion databases
- **Images:** Optimized and embedded in relevant pages
- **Code files:** Syntax highlighted and properly formatted

### Access Control
- **Internal content:** Restricted to team members
- **Public content:** Available to external stakeholders
- **Investor content:** Restricted to authorized investors

## Integration with Manus AI

### Task Assignment
- Tasks with priority â‰¥ 3 are automatically assigned to Manus
- Manus can create new tasks and update existing ones
- Real-time collaboration on documentation and code

### Content Generation
- Manus can generate documentation, diagrams, and reports
- AI-generated content is clearly marked and versioned
- Human review and approval workflow for critical content

### Context Awareness
- Manus has access to full project context
- Historical changes and decisions are preserved
- Cross-reference capabilities for related content

## Getting Started

1. **Configure API credentials** in `sync_config.yaml`
2. **Run initial sync:** `python notion_sync.py --sync-once`
3. **Start monitoring:** `python notion_sync.py`
4. **Verify Notion integration** in your workspace

## Best Practices

### For Human Developers
- Use descriptive commit messages and file names
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Review AI-generated content before finalizing
- Use the task system for coordination with Manus

### For AI Collaboration
- Provide clear context in task descriptions
- Use structured formats for complex information
- Include relevant metadata in file headers
- Follow established naming conventions

### For Project Management
- Regular sync status monitoring
- Backup verification and testing
- Access control review and updates
- Performance optimization based on usage patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Sync failures:** Check API credentials and network connectivity
- **File conflicts:** Use manual resolution tools in the sync interface
- **Large files:** Ensure files are under the size limit (50MB default)
- **Access denied:** Verify Notion permissions and sharing settings

### Support Resources
- Sync logs: `sync/logs/sync.log`
- Error reports: `sync/logs/errors.log`
- Configuration: `sync_config.yaml`
- Status dashboard: Run `python notion_sync.py --status`

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All API communications use TLS encryption
- Local files are encrypted at rest
- Access logs are maintained for audit purposes
- Sensitive content is automatically classified

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions for different content types
- Automatic access level detection based on file location
- Regular permission audits and updates
- Secure credential management

### Compliance
- GDPR compliance for personal data
- Audit trails for all synchronization activities
- Data retention policies and automated cleanup
- Privacy protection for sensitive information
