## Quick Start Guide

For users who want to get started immediately, this quick start guide provides a streamlined setup process that can have the automation system running in under 15 minutes.

### Express Setup (15 Minutes)

**Step 1: Download and Run Installation Script (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Windows (PowerShell as Administrator)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://setup-url/install_windows.ps1" -OutFile "install.ps1"
.\install.ps1

# macOS (Terminal)
curl -L "https://setup-url/install_macos.sh" -o install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh

# Linux (Terminal)
wget "https://setup-url/install_linux.sh" && chmod +x install_linux.sh && ./install_linux.sh
```

**Step 2: Configure Notion Integration (5 minutes)**
1. Visit https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
2. Create new integration: "Bulk Import Automation"
3. Copy integration token
4. Edit `config/environment.env` with your token

**Step 3: Start Automated Import (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Copy your 340 files to source_files/ directory
# Then run:
python scripts/bulk_file_analyzer.py source_files/
python scripts/automated_notion_importer.py
```

### One-Command Setup

For maximum convenience, the automation package includes a one-command setup script that handles the entire installation and configuration process automatically.

```bash
# One-command setup (all platforms)
curl -L "https://setup-url/quick_setup.sh" | bash -s -- --notion-token YOUR_TOKEN --source-path /path/to/files
```

This command downloads the automation package, installs all dependencies, configures the system, and starts the import process automatically.
