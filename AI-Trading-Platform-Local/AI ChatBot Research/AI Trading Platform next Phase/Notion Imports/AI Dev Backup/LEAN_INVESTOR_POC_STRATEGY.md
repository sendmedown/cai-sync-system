# 🎯 Lean Investor Proof-of-Concept Strategy
## Bio-Quantum AI Knowledge Engine - Seed Funding Approach

**Project**: Foundation Knowledge Base for Investor Demonstration  
**Approach**: Lean, Public Domain-Based Proof-of-Concept  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks to investor-ready demo  
**Budget**: Minimal (existing resources only)  
**Goal**: Demonstrate core IP and roadmap potential for seed funding  

---

## 🎯 Strategic Pivot: From Full Development to Investor POC

### Current Reality Assessment
- **Funding Status**: Pre-seed, need to demonstrate viability
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited development budget
- **Investor Requirements**: Proof of concept + clear roadmap + defensible IP
- **Market Opportunity**: First-mover advantage in AI-powered trading knowledge

### Lean POC Objectives
1. **Demonstrate Core IP**: Show unique knowledge engine architecture
2. **Prove Market Viability**: Display compelling user experience
3. **Establish Technical Credibility**: Working system with real data
4. **Present Clear Roadmap**: Path to full commercialization
5. **Attract Seed Funding**: $500K-$2M for full development
